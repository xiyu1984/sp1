# Prover Network Beta

> **Currently, the supported version of SP1 on the prover network is `v1.1.0`.**

So far we've explored how to generate proofs locally, but this can actually be inconvenient on local machines due to high memory / CPU requirements, especially for very large programs.

Succinct [has been building](https://blog.succinct.xyz/succinct-network/) the Succinct Prover Network, a distributed network of provers that can generate proofs of any size quickly and reliably. It's currently in private beta, but you can get access by following the steps below.

## Get your key whitelisted

**[FILL OUT THIS FORM](https://forms.gle/rTUvhstS8PFfv9B3A)** to gain access to the Succinct
Network. Completing this form requires you to complete the [key setup](#key-setup) steps below.

## Key Setup

The prover network uses Secp256k1 keypairs for authentication, similar to Ethereum wallets. You may generate a new keypair explicitly for use with the prover network, or use an existing keypair. **You do not need to hold any funds in this account, it is used solely for access control.**

After you have your whitelisted key, read the [Usage](./prover-network/usage.md) section to learn how to use it.

### Generate a new keypair with `cast`

Prover network keypair credentials can be generated using the
[cast](https://book.getfoundry.sh/cast/) CLI tool.

First install [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation#using-foundryup):

```sh
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Upon running this command, you will be prompted to source your shell profile and run `foundryup`. Afterwards you should have access to the `cast` command.

Use `cast` to generate a new keypair:

```sh
cast wallet new
```

which will give you an output similar to this:

The "Address" what you should submit in the [form](https://forms.gle/rTUvhstS8PFfv9B3A), in the example above this is `0x552f0FC6D736ed965CE07a3D71aA639De15B627b`. The "Private key" should be kept safe and
secure. When interacting with the network, you will set your `SP1_PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable
to this value.

### Retrieve an existing key

If you already have an existing key you would like to use, you can also use `cast` retrieve your address:

```sh
cast wallet address --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```
